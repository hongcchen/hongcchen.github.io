I am a PhD student in [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan. I am fortunate to be advised by [Misha Teplitskiy](https://www.misha.mx/) and [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/). 

I study science of science and innovation and have a broad interest in computational social science. My current research investigates global disparities in science and knowledge transfer within the science community. I adopt an interdisciplinary approach and use methods from NLP, network science, and causal inference in my research.

Previously, I received my Master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon University and my Bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University. After a circuitous journey, like solving a non-convex optimization problem, I unlock the thrill of computational social science. Now when I’m not playing with data, you can find me blazing the kitchen, searching for misplaced goggles, or honing my barista skills for a backup career plan.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
